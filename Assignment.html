		<h1>What is the origin of "Hello, world!"?</h1>

		<h3>It's the phrase you see everywhere in coding.  But where did it come from?</h3>

		<p>Have you every wondered where the phrase <q>Hello, world!</q> comes from?  I have.</p>

		<p>In fact, I just looked it up, and apparently, while its origin is somewhat unclear, it is commonly believed to have been first used by Brian Kernigham as example text in his book <I>A Tutorial Introduction to the Language B</I>.</p>

		<p>Ever since, the phrase <q>Hello, world!</q> has been used to introduce people in the programming world to new things.</p>

		<p>Here's what Wikipedia says: <blockquote>A "Hello, World!" program generally is a computer program that outputs or displays the message "Hello, World!". Such a program is very simple in most programming languages, and is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language. It is often the first program written by people learning to code.[1][2] It can also be used as a sanity test to make sure that computer software intended to compile or run source code is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it.</blockquote></p>
