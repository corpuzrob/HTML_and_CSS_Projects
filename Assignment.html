		<p>Have you every wondered where the phrase <q>Hello, world!</q> comes from?  I have.</p>

		<p>In fact, I just looked it up, and apparently, while its origin is somewhat unclear, it is commonly believed to have been first used by Brian Kernigham as example text in his book <I>A Tutorial Introduction to the Language B</I>.</p>

		<p>Ever since, the phrase <q>Hello, world!</q> has been used to introduce people in the programming world to new things.</p>
