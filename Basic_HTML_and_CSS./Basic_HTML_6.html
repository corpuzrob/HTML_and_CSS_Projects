      <h1>Excerpt from <i>Unguarded</i>:</h1>
      <p>My years in Chicago, beginning as a rookie in the fall of 1987, were the most rewarding of my career: twelve men coming together as one, fulfilling the dreams we had as kids in playgrounds across the land when all we needed was a ball, a basket, and our imagination. To be a member of the Bulls during the 1990s was to be part of something magical. For our times and for all time. Except...</p>

        <p>...Michael was determined to prove to the current generation of fans that he was larger-than-life during his day—and still larger than LeBron James, the player many consider his equal, if not superior. So Michael presented his story, not the story of the “Last Dance,” as our coach, Phil Jackson, billed the 1997–98 season once it became obvious the two Jerrys (owner Jerry Reinsdorf and general manager Jerry Krause) were intent on breaking up the gang no matter what happened. . . .<br><br>On and on it went, the spotlight shining on number 23.<br><br>Even in the second episode, which focused for a while on my difficult upbringing and unlikely path to the NBA, the narrative returned to MJ and his determination to win. I was nothing more than a prop. His “best teammate of all time,” he called me. He couldn’t have been more condescending if he tried. <br><br>On second thought, I could believe my eyes. I spent a lot of time around the man. I knew what made him tick. How naïve I was to expect anything else.<br>Each episode was the same: Michael on a pedestal, his teammates secondary, smaller, the message no different from when he referred to us back then as his “supporting cast.” From one season to the next, we received little or no credit whenever we won but the bulk of the criticism when we lost. Michael could shoot 6 for 24 from the field, commit 5 turnovers, and he was still, in the minds of the adoring press and public, the Errorless Jordan.  </p>

  Is Pippen right?  Here are some reasons for and against him:<br>

  <section>
    <h2>Why Scottie Pippen is right:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Spending so much time in <span style="color: red;"><i>The Last Dance</i></span> focusing on Pippen choosing to sit out when Jackson called the final shot for Kukoc in game 3 against the Knicks is just spiteful: Jordan wasn&apos;t even playing then, and the series was meant to be documenting the Bulls' final season leading to their sixth championship in <time datetime="1998">1998</time>.</li>
      <li>Jordan consistently referred to the rest of his team as <q>my supporting cast.</q></li>
      <li>Jordan never won a championship without Pippen.</li>
    </ol>

  <section>
    <h2>Why Michael Jordan is right:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>MJ gave Scottie props in <span style="color: red;"><i>The Last Dance</i></span>, saying <q>Whenever they speak Michael Jordan, they should speak Scottie Pippen.</q></li>
      <li>Pippen choosing not to have his surgery earlier in <time datetime="1998">1998</time>, along with getting a migraine in that game 7 against the Pistons, directly affected MJ and the Bulls.</li>
      <li>Pippen didn't do anything exceptional after MJ retired (the second time).</li>
