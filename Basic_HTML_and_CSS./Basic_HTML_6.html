  Scottie Pippen has expressed his anger and disappointment at the way Michael Jordan portrayed him in the series <i>The Last Dance</i>, saying that he (Jordan) <q>couldn't have been more condescending.</q><br><br>
  Here are some reasons why each might be right:<br>

  <section>
    <h2>Why Scottie Pippen is right:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Spending so much time in <i>The Last Dance</i> focusing on Pippen choosing to sit out when Jackson called the final shot for Kukoc in game 3 against the Knicks is just spiteful: Jordan wasn&apos;t even playing then.</li>
      <li>Jordan consistently referred to the rest of his team as <q>my supporting cast.</q></li>
      <li>Jordan never won a championship without Pippen.</li>
    </ol>

  <section>
    <h2>Why Michael Jordan is right:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>MJ gave Scottie props in <i>The Last Dance</i>, saying <q>Whenever they speak Michael Jordan, they should speak Scottie Pippen.</q>/li>
      <li>Pippen choosing not to have his surgery earlier in 1998, along with getting a migraine in that game 7 against the Pistons, directly affected MJ and the Bulls.</li>
      <li>Pippen didn't do anything exceptional after MJ retired (the second time).</li>
    </ol>
