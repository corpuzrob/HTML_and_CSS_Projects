    <p>It's time to say goodbye to some popular typefaces.  First of all, a "typeface" is a group of characters, letters and numbers that share the same design. The word "font" is often used when people are actually thinking of a typeface.  A "font" is actually a specific style within a "typeface," such as one using a particular size or characteristic (i.e. bold, italicized, underlined, etc.).  Now that we've cleared that up, let's talk about those typefaces that you probably shouldn't ever use again.</p>
    <div style="color:#000000;font-family:Times New Roman">
      <p>Times New Roman was originally designed for used in newspapers, and while there isn't anything intrinsically wrong with the typeface itself, having been the default in Microsoft products such as Word for many, many years, it has been used far, <i>far</i> too much.</p>
    </div>

    <div style="color:#5aaccf;font-family:Papyrus">
      <p>Whenever people want their product or service to seem exotic, natural, or (<i>sigh</i>) tribal, for some reason Papyrus seems to always be the first choice.  It is so ubiquitous that it's sickening.  Seriously, try looking around your town.  Yoga center?  Papyrus.  A place the sells incense or "waterpipes"?  Papyrus.  A movie taking place in a place with characters who don't wear shoes and live amonst trees?  You guessed it: papyrus.  The fact that James Cameron, who had access to the best possible resources and talent in Hollywood, decided to use the Papyrus font for the branding of his $237 million dollar movie Avatar, is an absolute abomination which was rightfully skewered in a famous <a href="https://youtu.be/jVhlJNJopOQ">Saturday Night Live sketch</a> featuring Ryan Gosling.</p>
    </div>

    <div style="color:#71c13f;font-family:Comic Sans MS">
      <p>Comic Sans sucks.  I mean, just look at this text.  It's awful.  Sorry, I guess shouldn't simply dismiss it without explaining myself.  Do you want to seem like you have less maturity than a four-year-old?  Want to look like you don't care at all about what you're trying to say, and have everyone immediately ignore your text as being not worth their time?  Use Comic Sans.</p>
    </div>
    <p>There are so many amazing typefaces available.  Please take some time to find one that you don't see everywhere, rather than one of the typefaces listed above, or other overused ones like, say, Helvetica.</p>
