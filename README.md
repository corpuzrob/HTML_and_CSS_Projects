# HTML_and_CSS_Projects
## Front End Web Design Projects

This is a display of sample websites that I created using HTML and CSS.

Projects:

* [Progressive Cause Site](https://github.com/corpuzrob/HTML_and_CSS_Projects/blob/main/Project/index.html)
* [Movie Theater Site](https://github.com/corpuzrob/HTML_and_CSS_Projects/blob/main/bootstrap4_project/academy_cinemas.html)

### Progressive Cause Site

This is an example home page for an organization.  It's styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.

### Movie Theater Site

This is an example home page for a movie theater that is styled using Bootstrap 4.  It contains many Boostrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.
